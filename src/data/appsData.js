    description: `Forest is a unique productivity app designed to help you stay focused and avoid phone distractions.
Instead of using traditional timers, it uses a fun, nature-inspired approach to time management.
When you want to concentrate, you plant a virtual seed that gradually grows into a tree as you stay focused.

This visual motivation helps you resist the urge to pick up your phone during work or study sessions.
Over time, your efforts build an entire digital forest that represents your focused moments.
The app follows the Pomodoro technique, letting you customize focus and break intervals.
You can unlock different tree species, backgrounds, and soundscapes as rewards for consistency.
Forest also partners with real-tree-planting organizations, allowing users to contribute to reforestation.
This makes your productivity journey not only meaningful but also environmentally impactful.
It tracks your daily and weekly focus trends through detailed statistics and insights.
You can tag sessions for studying, working, or reading to analyze your habits.
